In this project, users need to sign up and log in to give ratings and reviews for various tourist destinations. The platform allows users to explore all listings and add new ones once they are logged in. It supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on listings. I implemented proper error handling mechanisms, managed session states, and designed the layout of the web pages. The application uses Node.js and Express for the backend, MongoDB for the database, EJS and EJS-mate for templating, Passport for authentication, and Flash for displaying messages.

Key Features:

1) User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles using Passport.
2) CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete listings of tourist spots.
3) Rating and Reviews: Logged-in users can rate and review tourist places, enhancing community engagement.
4) Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling to ensure smooth user experience.
5) Session Management: Managed user sessions to maintain login states and provide personalized experiences.
6) User Interface: Designed a user-friendly layout using EJS and EJS-mate for dynamic content rendering.
7) Flash Messages: Used Flash to display success and error messages for better user feedback.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB
Templating: EJS, EJS-mate
